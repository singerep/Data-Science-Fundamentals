    "In this section we will fetch news articles from 3 different categories. We will perform Tfidf vectorization on the corpus of documents and use SVD to represent our corpus in the feature space of topics that we've uncovered from SVD. We will attempt to cluster the documents into 3 clusters as we vary the number of singular vectors we use to represent the corpus, and compare the output to the clustering created by the news article categories. Do we end up with a better clustering the more singular vectors we use?"

(for example in this space, the words \"King\" and \"Queen\" would be close).\n",

seems like you are eating breakfast in your grandmother s kitchen but seriously i like my grandmother s kitchen it is quite the experience and totally worth the perceived the coffee was fresh and dark the chocolate was to die for and the fruit covered french toast made from was sinful if i ever find myself in madison again i will definitely go out of my way to return to this little gem of a breakfast'), (0, 'the search for decent chinese in madison continues the food at this place we ordered delivery is nothing worth waiting hours for egg rolls which contain nothing but lo they clearly do not understand how to work with nor do they get how to deliver quality food in a timely fashion the one plus was the were still just save your time and money and don t bother not even a good of can make their ho food the reviews i ve seen from in house do not provide any contrast to our delivery experience'), (0, 'sorry but me fell way below the standard for even mediocre food first what s up with the popcorn okay so it is a balance between mexican and american well maybe but t it so american to understand that you always get a of chips and a bowl of at an american mexican restaurant even my 11 year old grandson wondered about it without my first enough about the popcorn my son ordered a he said it was okay it was prepared opposite of what is typically expected the and on the inside the meat served over the top of the my daughter ordered chicken she had nothing good to say about the dish the chicken looked and as if it was prepared in a bag in a it was not hot when it was served the which we assumed was were awful no one could not tell what they were made from the beans had an extremely odd texture probably the worse plate of we have ever experienced my mom ordered french soup really what is french soup doing on this menu t matter but of course it received a mediocre rating as well she also had a she did not comment on it i ordered the with chicken cheese and dressing on the side of all the dishes served this was actually pretty good not excellent but good all in all we all agreed this was the last time we would be here we all agreed me s has been the worse mexican restaurant we have experienced'), (1, 'disclaimer came here for the night scene so i have no on the food came here around 11 on a saturday night and i had a blast wells mixed with good music soft lights and lots of people the drinks were just strong enough to be worth and the service was very quick impressive for on saturday the dance floor had four or five displaying the music videos of the song playing and the floor was pretty big there is a large couch the dance floor and there a quite a few tables i was very happy with this no cover and people were dressed in heels and ties seemed a little bit too good for a bar without cover and cheap drinks i plan on coming back on a different night am not sure if i got lucky or if madison s is the place i want to come back to every saturday night'), (1, 'so this is the kind of food that will kill you so there s that but that being said this is the best way i can think of to take in food with absolutely no value the are sweet tender meat bars the sides are sweet flavor bombs of flavor the rolls are airy balls of you should get extra i think this place is best for you can sit and eat there are a handful of tables but then there are also bullet holes in the windows since it s madison i m assuming someone put them there for show but definitely with a real gun so anyway i d rather eat at home also if you ve been doing the house of cards thing and want that experience but you don t live in the south this is the closest you are going to get so check it out madison it s a little bit different but that t mean it t fabulous'), (0, 'it s so sad that my third time coming here is not a good experience it was okay not fantastic when i came here for the first and second time but today when i was really craving for some i decided to have it here it is during the lunch time but the restaurant still has way too many empty seats the waitress speaks very limited english so i can t ask her for some explanation on some menu we were given two glasses of water one for me the other for my hubby just when i wanted to drink i was surprised to learn the glass is super dirty which made me think they t wash it i asked the waitress to change it and she t say sorry at all and it s been twenty minutes and more but i don t think our order will come soon and oh the seem to be regulars too for this place while the overall place is not dirty i was wondering why this place t mind having some flying around the customer s tables my hubby s thai tea came after 25 minutes we ordered our food i can t wait to write this review as i don t remember the last time i ever had a very bad experience with a restaurant won t be back soon maybe next year or so and we had to pay tips not included such a waste'), (0, 'this is horrible the owner is a cheap shrew and the food is even compared to her sister s fare at the close to campus the owner of this park st location i hear they have now moved to sherman i believe was arrogant about the fact that their pad thai tastes like ketchup unlike the pad thai at legitimate restaurants could this be a cheap to the use of and other the owner said that how we do it here we use ketchup she explained that the reason the other was different pad thai is that the other one is owned by her sister who does not use ketchup in the dish then the cheap woman accused us of merely not wanting to pay for the food when it was being sent back to the kitchen the sister at the by campus cannot smile to save her life and you will come out of there like their kitchen but the food is better so go there and get it for'), (1, 'oh my gosh this is the best place in madison i m from out of town and i got excited when my friend told me about it i m a breakfast gal and they serve breakfast all day here i was so happy i got the saturday special and fire pepper with two eggs over medium a side of bacon and amazing every bite was mouth see pictures my friends and i split a banana cream pie and it was also good every bite i wish i got my own slice i wanted to try everything on the menu friendly kid friendly milk shakes breakfast great music outdoor what more could you ask for with this diner service was also excellent enjoy'), (0, 'atmosphere very nice clean trendy however extremely loud they really need some sound inside service this was the best part our waitress was very attentive and friendly food on the average side for the price point i had the soup ok chop good but could have used some more flavor very good and sweet potato excellent flavor but a lot of butter drinks friend had the old fashioned which i am not sure why they don t make a style old fashion sad to say the glass was very small full of ice and not even filled to the top with the drink for was very disappointed won t be going back but i wish them the best of luck in a very tough market'), (1, 'looking for beer this is the best spot in town with hundreds of choices you not be for decision my favorites are like blue and fruit that taste like sparkling wine the local new beer is also really tasty are you hungry no worries this place is the best in town for double fried done right every single time as said by the boss also the and v burger is also a hit if you re just looking for bar food the are really tasty as well i also like the fries but if i had to pick the are my favorite they also often do alot of beer probably once a month very fun activity the space was recently expanded there s more bar space and a few more tables if you re there with just a friend sit at the bar they serve the full menu there as well if you wanna go there in a group it might be hard unless you re there before great beer and a great selection of french wine as well what more can you ask for'), (0, 'so we decided to a try and drinks were fine my dinner and my wife s dinner were luke warm at least our two other friends had hot food served to them took ten minutes to get our meals back the owner came over to apologize but the waiter never did when we got our bill which was good bill for i expected to see something knocked off the bill due to having to send the food back last time i eat there and besides this review i will let others to go to our favorite mexican place la or del instead la'), (0, 'this place is probably alright if you re there for a few drinks on a with some friends but don t come here for the food or service my took me here while we were visiting this past week because she used to come here often when she lived in madison i expected a decent meal i ordered the chop special and it was both and horribly lacking on meat i sent it back and ordered the which was horribly no deal discount on the meal either which any decent restaurant would at least offer if they wanted your repeat business the waitress admitted that the chop was the worst she d ever seen lame tell the cook then and have the manager work on that poorly managed place with sub par service staff definitely won t be coming back here'), (0, 'is the perfect for we went with a group of friends of whom had been at the old location i have no complaints about the and really none about service neither stood out for good or bad reasons the food yeah the pizza was okay and yes i am aware this t supposed to be american pizza i ve tried pizza all over the globe and like each variation for its own reasons even my husband who will pretty much eat anything and at least say it was okay was pretty about it i had a special dish just based on that i would give a however because it s not a normal option and what i tried of my companions food was also it s not enough to raise the overall score upon leaving the restaurant my husband and i immediately named this a we won t pick this restaurant again but won t throw a huge fit if a group of friends want to go place thankfully we haven t had to go back'), (0, 'the two stars is for the food we had and my grandson had and cheese both delicious apparently the host had to host wait on tables and cook if you can t remember the order you should write it down ordered waited a very long time for our meals brought them out no told him to forget it half way through meal had to ask for bread which was suppose to come with the meal it was a terrible experience especially with a year old if your sign says open please have enough staff to your customers very poor management i go down the street to next time'), (1, 'i stopped here while on a road trip to for a bite and a brief by the highway signs this was the only place listed that was not a chain it s a couple miles off the road but easy to get to and easy to get back from i tried a beer it was good if perhaps a tiny bit more bitter on the finish than i m used to had a red which he thought was good he ordered the da as he was not terribly hungry joke was on him it was huge it was bigger than a small pizza it was pounds of goodness it came with two different and a cheese the were good the was amazing but the cheese was the generic day glow yellow crap he also had a cup of beer cheese soup unusual in that it contained he said it was okay but the addition was a bit odd i had cheese as we d recently crossed the border into and they were calling to me a former native they were good but not amazing they make the white variety and serve them with a sweet this was a good spot and a nice stop from the road'), (1, 'we had a large group at on a evening and were able to secure the private room upstairs which seats about a bit under 20 we got a set menu that included several options for each course i opted for the soup which was amazing it had a hint of cream in it which gave it a texture for my main i had the which was well and came with some nice except they t have the chocolate desert was like and a nice way to close out the evening the wine and beer list is pretty and includes variety in both type and price if you re in the madison area this is worth a stop after or before dinner there a few bars close by but you can also around the capital building and work off your meal this place is far enough away from state street that it t get to wild which makes it nice for a business meal or date night'), (1, 'this place is perfect if i lived anywhere nearby i d come all the time great alcohol selection great good live music and all really reasonably beer wise not only is their selection really extensive but you have the option to get most of the draft in smaller sizes to get a wider sample one of my favorite at any bar the burger was huge and delicious perfectly the take on a huge number of tables but are super efficient checking in with you exactly when you need them and not when you don t music wise don t worry that you re going to miss the start the band had just started to play at 10 and was at least an hour late that said we barely got a table at 10 so you might need to come early to grab at seat at this amazing bar'), (0, 'i ve heard people rave about brazilian and i finally went with high hopes but left really quite disappointed my overall impression is that is a and other assorted but a pain in the ass because you have to wait for someone to come by and cut off an portion of meat and you pay through the nose for it the taste of some of the food is ok you start with a of i got some chicken not good good but you can get them anywhere in the area for cheap and cheese filled rolls excellent but you should probably not fill up too much since the real experience is in the and that the bring to your table at you flip a big red green plastic thing to indicate when you want food if you have it green side up then will come by your table and cut off a piece of meat or and so on until you flip your thing back over to red so you can eat the was quite good the leg of was well but the meat was a bit too for my liking the top was disappointing as hell there were a couple decent bites but the i got were mostly and some pieces were loaded with the has and sugar and just tastes like warm with and sugar assuming you get a piece with and sugar on it which only outside pieces have i was greatly disappointed by a few of the like and honey chicken with the exception of the which was quite good but not special i was overall pretty disappointed i am not brazilian and am not an expert but i have had brazilian food before if you t tell me that was brazilian i would never have guessed it was supposed to be critically are like the drink of brazil and the one i had at was the worst one i ever had that s disappointing since they re one of my favorite the service was we were there at a on they open at and the place t getting full until we just about finished our meal but it still took forever for our drinks to get get our bill etc i don t blame our waitress so much it seemed like she just had a lot of tables to take care of i think if you re 37 or whatever a plate you can afford to hire adequate staff overall as many other reviewers have already said the quality of food does not justify the price my fiance and i had two two and a fountain drink which cost us over 100 and it was in no way worth 100 let alone even half that if i were to ignore the price i d give stars but i can t rate them at any more than given the high price for pedestrian food'), (1, 'first time in a which witch and i was surprised efficient and interesting set up with reasonable prices this chain had the as a special and it was way better than i expected it to be i usually get mine from legitimate stores and i was expecting this one to be a huge let down especially since it s a white chain racist maybe sorry not sure maybe if i have to ask it is yes the is a little different than the original and it s missing the but seriously a solid variation definitely would come again'), (1, 'the burger with ketchup is by far the best thing on the lunch and dinner menu always has great on tap and plenty of variety in menu offerings it is well known that folks in the area go for half price happy hour although tonight we went at typical happy hour time and we did not receive happy hour prices this is the main reason we go prior to and will continue to visit regardless of happy hour deals but this is a nice needless to say we will be back but we will also select a different spot for post work drinks since their deals have become unclear')]\n"
